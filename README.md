🚀 AgentLayer Builder: Ushering in the Era of Accountable AI Agents
💡 Vision: AI Agents, Now Under Your Control!
AgentLayer is an innovative platform that helps AI agents transcend being mere tools to become truly 'Accountable Team Members'.
It enables anyone to easily create AI agents, imbue them with a 'Constitution' they must adhere to, and automatically establishes an operating system that includes transparent monitoring of all execution flows.

No longer worry about the opaque decisions of AI. AgentLayer creates AI agents optimized for your business and endows all their actions with 'Responsibility and Rules'.

🔥 Core Features
🎨 Visual Workflow Builder (Frontend)
ReactFlow-based Drag & Drop UI: Visually design complex AI agent workflows with an intuitive node-based interface.

Left Panel: Node library offering various functionalities like Start, AI Chat, API Call, Conditional Branch, Data Filter, Document Upload, Vector Embedding, Context Query.

Center Canvas: Assemble the flow by connecting nodes with edges, defining the agent's execution path and data pipeline.

Right Panel: Dynamic panel for real-time editing and configuration of properties for selected nodes (e.g., prompt, API URL, condition statements).

Real-time Execution Visualization:

Visually highlights the currently active node during workflow execution.

Failed or constitution-violating nodes are immediately marked in red, allowing for quick identification of issues.

Execution logs are streamed in real-time, providing transparent insight into every decision and action taken by the agent.

Workflow Save and Load: Save configured workflows as JSON and load them back for reuse when needed.

⚙️ Powerful Backend (Express.js + TypeScript)
RESTful API:

POST /api/workflow: Saves a new Agent workflow.

POST /api/execute: Executes a configured workflow.

GET /api/execution/:id/logs: Streams real-time logs for a specific execution via WebSocket.

POST /api/report: Saves constitution rule violation reports.

Database (PostgreSQL, Drizzle ORM): Schemas for users, workflows, executions, logs, violation_reports, constitution_rules are defined, necessary for AgentLayer operations. Initially uses in-memory storage, with an easy migration path to actual PostgreSQL DBs like Supabase.

LangGraph-style Execution Engine: Dynamically transforms the visually defined node and edge flows (JSON) from the frontend into a LangGraph-like executable pipeline structure on the backend to power the agents.

🧠 MCP (Main Control Plane): The Agent's Brain and Command Center
Acts as the central control node, coordinating and managing all AI Agent workflow executions within AgentLayer.

Oversees execution order, conditional branching, error handling, and iterative processing for complex agent logic.

Every node's execution must pass through the MCP, enabling the Constitution Layer's monitoring and, if necessary, halting capabilities.

📚 RAG Structure (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): Knowledge-Driven Intelligent Agents
Agents retrieve necessary knowledge from documents/data uploaded or connected by the user via DocumentUploadNode.

EmbedVectorNode converts documents into vectors, and QueryContextNode efficiently searches a vector database for relevant context.

AI Agent nodes like AIChatNode always respond and act based on this retrieved context, enabling them to make informed decisions grounded in the user's unique data.

🛡️ Constitution Layer (Ethical Monitoring): Ensuring Accountable Agent Behavior
Monitors Agent workflow execution before, during, and after based on a robust set of rules defined in the server/constitution.json file.

Upon rule violation:

Displays immediate alerts in the builder UI to warn the user.

(Future Expansion) Instantly transmits violation details to external communication channels like Slack.

Saves detailed violation reports to the backend, ensuring transparent management of all rule violations.

Rule Examples: Prohibition of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) leakage, mandatory validation for external API calls, source citation in RAG responses, etc.

🚀 Seamless Automated Deployment
GitHub Integration: The project is ready to be pushed to a GitHub repository, facilitating version control.

Vercel Deployment Optimization: The React frontend is configured for easy deployment via Vercel with just a few clicks.

Supabase Integration Option: The database schema is defined to integrate with Supabase (PostgreSQL), allowing for a smooth transition to a production-grade database.

💡 Additional Features (Future Vision)
Constitution Rule Editor: A dedicated builder within the UI to visually edit and manage constitution rules.

Execution Replay Feature: Ability to replay past workflow execution logs to visually review and analyze agent behavior.

Agent Reputation Scoring System: A system to assign reputation scores to agents or workflows based on their execution success rate and constitution adherence.

Workflow Template Save & Share: Functionality to save frequently used workflow patterns as templates, and a marketplace to share and reuse them.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, ReactFlow, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS, Zustand (state management), TanStack Query (data fetching)

Backend: Express.js, TypeScript, WebSocket (real-time logs), Drizzle ORM (DB schema definition)

Database: PostgreSQL (currently with in-memory fallback)

Development Environment: Node.js, npm, Git, TypeScript

🚀 Quick Start
Here's how to run this project locally or deploy it to GitHub.

1. Clone the Project (from GitHub)
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/no-code-agent-builder.git
cd no-code-agent-builder

Replace yourusername with your GitHub username.

2. Install Dependencies
From the project root, run the following command to install all frontend and backend dependencies:

npm install

3. Start Development Servers
Start both the frontend and backend in development mode simultaneously:

npm run dev

The frontend will run at http://localhost:5173 (Vite default port).

The backend will run at http://localhost:3000.

Client requests to /api will be proxied to the backend.

4. Production Build and Run
To build and run the project for production deployment:

 Build client and server
npm run build

 Run the built server
npm run start

5. GitHub Repository Setup
This project is already prepared to be pushed to GitHub. After setting up the package.json and other files locally, follow these steps:

Create a new repository on GitHub: Create an empty repository named no-code-agent-builder on GitHub. (Do not add a README, .gitignore, or License.)

Initialize and connect local Git: From your project's root folder, run the following commands:

git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: AgentLayer No Code Builder project"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/no-code-agent-builder.git
git push -u origin main

Replace yourusername with your GitHub username.

6. Vercel Deployment (Frontend)
Create/Log in to Vercel Account: Go to vercel.com and log in with your GitHub account.

Import New Project: From the Vercel dashboard, select Add New... -> Project.

Select GitHub Repository: Choose your no-code-agent-builder repository.

Project Configuration:

Root Directory: Set to client.

Build & Output Settings: Vercel will automatically detect the Vite project and run npm run build. (Specify Framework Preset as Vite if needed.)

Environment Variables: Configure necessary environment variables for the backend API URL (e.g., VITE_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=https://your-backend-api.com).

Deploy: Click the Deploy button. Vercel will build and deploy the frontend, providing a unique URL.

7. Supabase Integration (PostgreSQL)
Create Supabase Project: Create a new project at supabase.com.

Get DB Connection String: In your Supabase project settings, find and copy the Database -> Connection String.

Set Environment Variables:

Local .env file (create in project root): DATABASE_URL="your_supabase_connection_string"

Backend deployment environment (e.g., Render, Fly.io): Add DATABASE_URL to the platform's environment variables.

Schema Migration (Optional):

Use drizzle-kit to apply the schema to your Supabase DB:

npm run db:push
Or generate migration files and apply:
npm run db:generate
After reviewing generated migration files:
npx drizzle-kit migrate # Apply migrations to the actual DB

Modify server/storage.ts to implement actual DB integration using Drizzle ORM instead of in-memory storage.

This project will be a powerful starting point for realizing the core vision of AgentLayer. Refer to the comments in each file to expand and refine its functionalities.
